Doug Napoleone brought Icetowers to pycon2007, and we got **way** too addicted.

This is a yet unfinished icetowers clone. It's networked, multiplayer, and an AI is planned, but not yet done. Since you move the pieces with the mouse, only one person can typically play per computer.

Of the three basic IceTowers moves, only cap and mining are working. Splitting will be coming soon.
